Which of the following statements about diagnostics are true? Check all that apply.

- [ ] It’s hard to tell what will work to improve a learning algorithm, so the best approach is to go with gut feeling and just see what works.
- [X] Diagnostics can give guidance as to what might be more fruitful things to try to improve a learning algorithm.
- [X] Diagnostics can be time-consuming to implement and try, but they can still be a very good use of your time.
- [X] A diagnostic can sometimes rule out certain courses of action (changes to your learning algorithm) as being unlikely to improve its performance significantly.

Suppose you fit a neural network with one hidden layer to a training set. You find that the cross validation error J-CV(θ) is much larger than the training error J-train(θ). Is increasing the number of hidden units likely to help?

- [ ] Yes, because this increases the number of parameters and lets the network represent more complex functions.
- [ ] Yes, because it is currently suffering from high bias.
- [ ] No, because it is currently suffering from high bias, so adding hidden units is unlikely to help.
- [X] No, because it is currently suffering from high variance, so adding hidden units is unlikely to help.
